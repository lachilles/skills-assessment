       Since "bagon" ends with n, find the *first* word starting
       with "n" in our list --- in this case, "nosepass".

    4. Add "nosepass" to the results, and continue. Once a word has
       been used, it can't be used again --- so we'll never get to
       use "bagon" or "nosepass" a second time.

    5. When you can't find an unused word to use, you're done!
       Return the list of output words.

    For example::

    (After "baltoy", there are no more y-words, so we end, even
    though "nicky" and "booger" weren't used.)

    This is a tricky problem. In particular, think about how using
    a dictionary (with the super-fast lookup they provide) can help;
    good solutions here will definitely require a dictionary.
