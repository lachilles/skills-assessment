def merge_sort(lst):

    Given a list, returns a sorted version of that list.
    Finish the merge sort algorithm by writing another function that
    that takes in a single unsorted list of integers and uses recursion and the 'merge_lists'
    function you already wrote to return a new sorted list containing all integers from
    thin input list. In other words, the new function should sort a list using merge_lists
    and recursion.
